# README

## What is this?
This is a repo of exercises in JavaScript with the aim of becoming more knowledgable about the core functions available in JavaScript.
Basically it goes through all the Mozilla Mdn docs and has a little example of each core function available.

## How to 'run' it?
Currently this uses Node version 12. 

Run any of the files with `node filename.js` from the root to see the output of a given example. e.g. `node arrays/do not mutate/returns a boolean/every.js`
